# Arsenic-Concentration-Detection-in-Rice-using-A-Mobile-Phone

  Collaborated with faculty members from both Chemistry and ECE departments of UMass Amherst to design a low-cost
and simple method to determine the inorganic arsenic concentration in rice that causes long term adverse health effects

  Researched and tested various color spaces and image segmentation techniques on smartphone images with circular
color spots corresponding to the inorganic arsenic concentration

  Evaluated multiple parameters, such as lightness and pixel sizes of the color spots, to obtain a more accurate arsenic
range representation of the rice

  Implemented the image analyses on an iOS mobile application using Swift, C++, and OpenCV

  Delivered a PowerPoint presentation to faculty advisors and submitted a technical thesis document to the
Commonwealth Honors College at UMass Amherst
